README

This is a file that contains some problems of this MyTi.MyTiSystem.

First, this is a Assignment of Advanced Programming course.
******************************************************************

There are many method that never used.
The default setting of the purchase valid time is 00:00 to 24:00 as one day.
If purchase a one day pass, it will valid for onr day to 24:00.

Because the project is generate by Intellij IDEA, the .xml file in folder .idea are auto generated.

//Many admin function already have method to support, but not connect yet.
//Such as setting ticket's price.
Setting ticket's price now available.

//Knew problem is that this project is not finished yet...
The project is almost finished.

When testing the program. Use the option that marked as testing, because the non-testing option is automatic generate
time and station. These option is design for "real use".

When running the program, add User and MyTi.Station at first, or simply run main method in Test class, or obey the format
in Test class.

** The MyTi.TravelPass History and MyTi.Station Statistics report may cause null pointer exception (no testing yet). **
But the auto generate time purchase function looks good.

Many main Function is in MyTi.MyTiSystem class, but some function is in MyTi.UsersData class,
such as get rate for concession.
//simply change the rate in getRate method in MyTi.UsersData can change the whole rate of Ticket.
Now change concession is available using Admin option.
The class Data is no used in this project, this class is design for writing and reading data from file or database,
and the class is not finished, maybe can be used in other version.

Some function in MyTi.MyTiSystem has been commented but these function leave there for further used.

Comment in MyTi.MyTiSystem class may clearly show the function and link the methods up.


Many code in purchase methods can be reusable, but time limitation.
These can be fix if there are more time in coding.

The code is also available in GitHub ( https://github.com/TonyZXY/APAssignment1MyTiSystem )
(Used to be in ( https://github.com/XuyangZheng/APAss1 ))
Progress can be check in GitHub, there are also some very briefly comment.
